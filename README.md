# Big Mart Sales Prediction

## üìù Project Overview

This project aims to predict the sales of products in various Big Mart outlets. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately forecast sales based on a product's and outlet's attributes. This can help Big Mart optimize inventory management, understand customer behavior, and make better business decisions.

The analysis, data preprocessing, and model training are all contained within the `BigMart_Project.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.
